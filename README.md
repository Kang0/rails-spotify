This application is a web program which allows users to sign up through e-mail or facebook.
Once a user has created an account, they can browse the spotify database to find the vinyl that is in their collection. Once the vinyl has been added to the collection
the user can sort through their collection by either oldest, newest, highest rated, or lowest rated.

Once a vinyl has been added to the collection, the user may also write a review that contains a title, content, rating, and either recommend or not recommend the vinyl.
The website allows other users to browse different vinyl's and view other user's reviews as well as the average rating for the vinyl given all the user's ratings. 

Furthermore, the website also contains a page that displays information about the vinyl, such as album name, artist name, tracks, label, copyrights.

Enjoy!
